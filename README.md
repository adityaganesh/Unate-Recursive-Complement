# Unate-Recursive-Complement
This is a python code of implementation of Unate Recursive Complement which was a part of my honors assignment in VLSI PART 1:-LOGIC course from coursera
# What is this?
In URC we are provided with a cubelist which basically represents a sum of product terms of boolean variables. Now you might think what is so difficult about finding a complement of a SOP but now think if we need to find complement of a SOP with 10 variables and 200 SOPs and now we realize this gets difficult and so we need to come up with a algorithm to find out the complement.
I wont get into the details of the algorithm as its pretty lengthy if you know about the algorithm the code is pretty self explainatory
